## 📊 Test Reports

### Coverage Reports

Unit tests generate coverage reports in `coverage/` directory:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Performance Reports

Performance tests generate `performance-report.json`:

```bash
npm run test:performance
cat performance-report.json
```

### E2E Reports

Playwright generates HTML reports:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🔍 Test Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. **Arrange, Act, Assert** pattern
2. **Descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
3. **Mock external dependencies** for isolation
4. **Test both success and error cases**
5. **Use realistic test data**

### Performance Testing

1. **Set realistic thresholds** based on user expectations
2. **Test on different devices** and network conditions
3. **Monitor memory usage** and cleanup
4. **Test with realistic data volumes**

### E2E Testing

1. **Test critical user paths** first
2. **Use page object patterns** for maintainability
3. **Handle async operations** properly
4. **Test across different browsers**

## 🚀 Running Tests in Development

### Watch Mode for Rapid Development

```bash
# Unit tests with hot reload
npm run test:watch

# E2E tests with UI for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Pre-commit Testing

```bash
# Quick test suite for commits
npm run test -- --passWithNoTests --watchAll=false
npm run test:performance
```

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tests fail with database errors:**

```bash
# Ensure database is running and accessible
npx prisma db push
```

**E2E tests timeout:**

```bash
# Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
# Ensure dev server is running
npm run dev
```

**Performance tests show poor results:**

```bash
# Ensure you're testing production build
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Your application passes all tests when:

- ✅ Unit test coverage > 70%
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ Performance benchmarks are met
- ✅ E2E tests pass across browsers
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ Bundle size within limits

Run the complete test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
yarn test:all
```
